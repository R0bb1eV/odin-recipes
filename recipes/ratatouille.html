      This ratatouille recipe makes the elegant French vegetable dish served up in the Disney movie of the same name. 
      Long and narrow slices of colorful eggplant, zucchini, and summer squash work best and turn out tender every time!

    <p>
      In 2007, ratatouille was officially introduced into the American pop culture by way of Remy, the French rat that loved to cook. 
      In the film, protagonist Remy wins over snobby food critics with ratatouille, including an iconic kitchen scene wherein the dish is prepared for audiences.

      However, the ratatouille in this film isn't an accurate representation of the dish. Disney Pixar hired acclaimed chef Thomas Keller as a consultant to make sure the kitchen scenes were authentic, down to the texture of the vegetables.
      Classic ratatouille isn't necessarily a pretty dish. To solve this issue, Thomas Keller recommended a more upscale, presentable version called confit byaldi. 
      Named after a Turkish eggplant dish, confit byaldi requires chefs to use a mandolin or their expert knife skills to assemble razor-thin slices of vegetables which bake together in an oven.

      <li>½ onion, chopped</li>

      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 small eggplant, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 zucchini, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 yellow squash, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 yellow bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons mascarpone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
          Spread tomato paste onto the bottom of a 10-inch square baking dish. 
          Sprinkle with onion and garlic. 
          Stir in water and 1 tablespoon olive oil until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper, starting at the outer edge of the dish and working concentrically towards the center. 
        Overlap slices a little to display colors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle vegetables with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; season with salt and pepper. 
        Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Cover vegetables with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender, about 45 minutes. 
        Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese if desired.
