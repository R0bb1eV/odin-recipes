  <p>
    The word soup, and it’s many historical variations, has been used for hundreds of years across Europe. 
    It generally refers to any broth-based bowl of food (yup, quite vague). 
    Bisque, on the other hand, has a concrete beginning in 17th century France. 
    We’ll get more into the history of the word later, but around 1640, it translated to something like “crayfish soup”.

    It is possible to find lobster bisques, ready made, in cans, including the frozen forms of the soup that only requires boiling water for it to be cooked. 
    However, none of these options beat the thrill of preparing lobster bisque with your own ingredients and fresh lobster.
